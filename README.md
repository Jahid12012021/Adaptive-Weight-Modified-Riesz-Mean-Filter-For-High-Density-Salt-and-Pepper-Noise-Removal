# Adaptive Weight Modified Riesz Mean Filter For High Density Salt and Pepper Noise Removal
This paper introduces a novel filter, the Adaptive Weight Modified Riesz Mean Filter (AWMRmF), designed for the effective removal of high-density salt and pepper noise (SPN). AWMRmF integrates a pixel weight function and adaptivity condition inspired by the Different Adaptive Modified Riesz Mean Filter (DAMRmF). In my simulations, I evaluated the performance of AWMRmF against established filters such as Adaptive Frequency Median Filter (AFMF), Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (AWMF), Adaptive Cesaro Mean Filter (ACmF), Adaptive Riesz Mean Filter (ARmF), and Improved Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (IAWMF). The assessment was conducted on 26 typical test images, varying noise levels from 60% to 95%. The findings indicate that, in terms of both Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) metrics, AWMRmF outperformed other state-of-the-art filters. Furthermore, AWMRmF demonstrated superior performance in mean PSNR and SSIM results as well.
