# Adaptive-Weight-Modified-Riesz-Mean-Filter-For-High-Density-Salt-and-Pepper-Noise-Removal
This paper introduces a novel filter, the Adaptive Weight Modified Riesz Mean Filter (AWMRmF), designed for the effective removal of high-density salt and pepper noise (SPN). AWMRmF integrates a pixel weight function and adaptivity condition inspired by the Different Adaptive Modified Riesz Mean Filter (DAMRmF).
